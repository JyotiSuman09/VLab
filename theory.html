                <p>Decoder:</p>
                <p>&emsp;
                  Decoder is a combinational logic circuit that converts the binary
                  information from n coded inputs to a maximum of 2 n unique outputs.
                </p>
                <center><img src="assets/img/2.png" alt=""></center>
                 <p> Applications of Decoder:</p>
                 <p>   Decoder are used to input data to a specified output line as is
                  done in addressing core memory.</p>
                  <p> It is used n code conversion.</p>
                  <p> It is also used for data distribution i.e., demultiplexing</p>
                  <p> It is used as address decoders in CPU memory location
                  identification.</p>
                  <p> It decodes the binary input to activate the LED segments so
                  that the decimal number can be displayed.</p>
                  <p> They can be the application of switching function often with
                  the fewer integrated circuit.STUCK AT FAULT:</p>
                  <p>Before direct jumping into Stuck at Fault let’s know about what is
                  fault modelling?</p>
                 <p> After manufacturing a chip, the number of physical defects in a chip
                  can be too many i.e., may be infinitely large. So many times, this is
                  impossible to count and analyse all possible faults. So, while testing a
                  circuit/IC we abstract physical defects and define some logical fault
                  models.</p>
                  <p>In this way:</p>
                  <p> We reduce the number of faults to be considered.</p>
                  <p> Makes test generation and fault simulation possible.</p>
                  <p> We can quantitatively compare test-sets to minimize the faults
                  as minimum as possible.</p>
                  <p>Note: Defining fault models doesn’t mean circuit has these faults. We
                  only assume that circuit is behaving like that.</p>
                  <p>There are different levels of abstraction of fault modelling:</p>
                  <p>Behavioral</p>
                  <p>Functional</p>
                  <p>Structural</p>
                  <p>Switch level</p>
                  <p>Geometrical</p>
                  <p>Among these, the stuck at fault model comes under structural level
                  fault model and there are 2 types of stuck at fault modelling:</p>
                  <p> Single stuck at fault modelling</p>
                  <p> Multiple stuck at fault modelling</p>
                  <p>Among these two single stuck at fault modelling is most popular.
                  why?</p>
                  <p>1. Due to simplicity of single stuck at model it has been widely
                  used to taste ICs.</p>
                  <p>2. Some interesting results that A test set that detect all single
                  stuck at fault detect about >95% of multiple stuck at fault.</p>
                  <p>3. For tree like circuit it detects all multiple stuck at faults.
                  SINGLE STUCK AT FAULT MODELLING:</p>
                  <p> Here we assume the elements (i.e., gates) are absolutely fault
                  free and circuit lines have fault that they are permanently fixed
                  at logic 1 or logic 0 due to some failure. (at only one at a given
                  time)</p>
                  <p> Very popular fault model as it can model realistic physical
                  failures.</p>
                  <p> Faults on line A denoted as “s-a-0” or A/0 similarly for stuck at
                  1 it is “s-a-1” or A/1.</p>
                  <p> Total number of possible stuck at fault position is:</p>
                  <p>No. of gates + No. of input and output + 2*no. of fanout nodes</p>

                  <p>However, the testing positions can be minimized by</p>
                  <p> Fault equivalence</p>
                  <p> Fault dominance</p>
                  <p>How to minimize stuck at fault position:</p>
                  <p>1. Fault equivalence:</p>
                  <p> Two faults f1 and f2 are equivalent if all tests that detect f1 also
                  detect f2.Example:</p>
                  <center><img width: 450px; src="assets/img/1.png" alt=""></center>
                  <p>From total 6 possible faults, we can rule, sa0 at A and sa0 at B
                  and reduce to total 4 possible faults.</p>
                  <p> If f1 and f2 are equivalent then for both the faulty function is
                  same.</p>
                  <p>2.Fault Dominance:</p>
                  <p> If all tests for some fault f1 detect another fault f2, then f2 is
                  said to dominate f1.</p>
                  <p> If fault f2 dominates f1, then f2 is removed from the fault list.
                  Example:</p>
                  <center><img width=450px src="assets/img/a1.jpg" alt=""></center>
                  <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> If two faults dominate each other then they are equivalent.</p>
