            <div class="theo">
              <p>
                &emsp;After manufacturing a chip, the number of physical defects
                in a chip can be too many i.e., may be infinitely large. So many
                times, this is impossible to count and analyse all possible
                faults. So, while testing a circuit/IC we abstract physical
                defects and define some logical fault models.
              </p>
              <p>In this way</p>
              <ul>
                <li>It reduces the number of faults to be considered.</li>
                <li>Makes test generation and fault simulation possible.</li>
                <li>
                  We can quantitatively compare test-sets to minimize the faults
                  as minimum as possible.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Note: Defining fault models doesn’t mean circuit has these
                faults. We only assume that circuit is behaving like that.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are different levels of abstraction of fault modelling:
              </p>
              <p>
                Behavioural, Functional, Structural, Switch level, Geometrical
              </p>
              <p>
                Among these, the stuck at fault model comes under structural
                level fault model and there are 2 types of stuck at fault
                modelling:
              </p>
              <p>
                Single stuck at fault modelling, Multiple stuck at fault
                modelling.
              </p>
              <p>
                Among these two, single stuck at fault modelling is most
                popular. why?
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Due to simplicity of single stuck at model it has been widely
                  used to taste ICs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some interesting results that A test set that detect all
                  single stuck at fault detect about >95% of multiple stuck at
                  fault.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For tree like circuit, it detects all multiple stuck at
                  faults.
                </li>
              </ol>

            <span>DECODER :</span>
            <div class="theo">
              <p>
                Decoder is a combinational logic circuit that converts the
                binary information from n coded inputs to a maximum of 2^n
                unique outputs.
              </p>

                <img src="assets/img/2.png" alt="Decoder" />
              </center>
              <p>
                Sometimes an additional input is given as “Enable” to activate
                the circuit, it activates when enable input is at logic level
                “1” and deactivates when it is at logic level “0”. Basically it
                decodes the coded binary inputs to corresponding output. As n
                bits can represent 2^n numbers similarly here n inputs represent
                a single output as “1” and other outputs as “0”.
              </p>
              <span>4x16 decoder using 3x8 decoder :</span>
              <p>
                The parallel inputs A0, A1 & A2are applied to each 3x8 decoder
                along with an enable input A3, which accordingly activates the
                two decoders as it becomes ‘0’ and ‘1’ respectively. The outputs
                D0 to D7 (the first eight minterms) are corresponding to enable
                at ‘0’ and outputs D8 to D15 (the last eight minterms) are
                corresponding to enable at ‘1’.
